Assignment instructions: Write function last_week that reads the top40 data set mentioned in the above exercise. The function should then try to reconstruct the top40 list of the previous week based on that week's list. Try to do this as well as possible. You can fill the values that are impossible to reconstruct by missing value symbols. Your solution should work for a top40 list of any week. So don't rely on specific features of this top40 list. The column WoC means "Weeks on Chart", that is, on how many weeks this song has been on the top 40 list.
