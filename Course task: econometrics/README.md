5. (S&W E12.1) How does fertility affect labor supply? In this exercise, you will
estimate this effect using data for married women from the 1980 U.S. Census. The
data are available on the textbook website in the file Fertility_Small. The data
set contains information on married women aged 21â€“35 with two or more children.
a) Regress weeks worked on the indicator variable morekids using OLS. On
average, do women with more than two children work less than women with
two children? How much less?
b) Explain why the OLS regression estimated in (a) is inappropriate for estimat-
ing the causal effect of fertility (morekids) on labor supply (weeks worked).
c) The data set contains the variable samesex, which is equal to 1 if the first
two children are of the same sex and equal to 0 otherwise. Are couples whose
first two children are of the same sex more likely to have a third child? Is the
effect large? Is it statistically significant?
d) Explain why samesex is a valid instrument for the IV regression of weeks
worked on morekids.
e) Is samesex a weak instrument?
f) Estimate the regression of weeks worked on morekids using samesex as an
instrument. How large is the fertility effect on labor supply?
g) Do the results change when you include the variables agem1, black, hispan,
and othrace in the labor supply regression (treating these variables as ex-
ogenous)? Explain why or why not.
